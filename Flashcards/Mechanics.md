# Mechanics

## Momentum

A measure of mass in motion: p = mv

---

## vector quantity, SI unit: kg*m/s [direction]

Conservation of Momentum
For an isolated system, the total momentum of all objects interacting with each other remains constant: pbefore = pafter

---

## Kinetic Energy

The energy associated with objects in motion:
K.E. = Â½ mv2  

scalar quantity, SI unit: Joules

---

## Potential Energy

Energy that is stored inside an object due to its position

---

## Gravitational Potential Energy

Energy stored in objects that have been lifted off the ground: P.E. = mgh
scalar quantity, SI unit: Joules

---

## Elastic Collision

A type of collision where kinetic energy is conserved

---

## Inelastic Collision

A type of collision where kinetic energy is transformed into something else during collision, like thermal energy, noise, or deformation

---

## Perfectly Inelastic Collision

The same as an inelastic collision, but objects remain in contact together

---

## Conservation of Energy

For an isolated system, the Total Energy remains constant over time: T.E. = K.E. + P.E.

---

## Energy Conversion

When energy changes from one form to another
