# Motion

## Vocab

### Newton's 1st Law

An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in
motion will stay in motion, until a net force acts upon it

### Newton's 2nd Law

The greater the mass of an object, the more force it will take to accelerate the object. The greater the force acting on an object, the greater the acceleration of the object. F = ma

### Newton's 3rd Law

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

### Inertia

The resistance an object has to change its state of motion. The more massive an object is, the more it tends to resist a change in motion.

### Mass

How much matter—or "stuff"—is in an object. Mass is not dependent on physical size!

### Force

A push or pull

### Weight

The force of gravity acting on an object

### Normal Force

The force that surfaces exert to prevent bodies from passing through each other

### Friction

The force between two surfaces that prevents those surfaces from sliding or slipping across each other

### Drag

A force acting opposite to the motion of an object moving through a fluid (gas or liquid)

### Free Body Diagram

A way to visualize applied forces acting on an object
