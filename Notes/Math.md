# Notes

## Finding domain without graphing

- Find 0

### Examples

#### 4x^3

- Check if there is anything x cannot be
- With cubic functions. anything works
- Domain: (-infinity, infinity), IR

#### Y=3e^2x

- Exponential
- Same thing, X can be anything

#### Y=3/X

- Reciprocal
- X is in denominator. so X=0 is not posable
- Domain {x>0} {x<0}, IR except X=0, (-infinity, 0) U (0, infinity)

#### Y=x+2/3x^2 +4x

- Y=x+2/3x^2 +4x = 0
- Steps
  - Set denominator to 0
  - Solve for X
  - Domain is everything else
